# js-journey


This repo is where is going to be files that I'm working on to learn the skills to further apply in JavaScript projects.
Recently I decided to put some of my fcc challenges here. 

Only the Basic and Intermidiate Algorithm Scripting since they are not lessons but exercises to pratice JS concepts.


* What I'm learning:
  * Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures (freeCodeCamp)

* What I've been working on:
  * Mini Project Canvas (using HTML5 Canvas)
